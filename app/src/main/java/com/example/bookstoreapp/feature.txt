I create Sign Up and Login feature.
if you click create account button, the information of user name and password will be
saved in firebase. In firebase root is "users" and child will be their user name, so that
I can search with user name when user login. after sign up the screen automatically changed
to Login screen, and if user click Login button, from firebase, user name will be searched.
if there is user successfully login, otherwise show message accordingly.
in MainActivity, use boolean to detect this user is authenticated or not.
after login user will be passed to MainActivity screen with "Authorized" key and true.
